### An indepth look at the perfomance of San Fransisco's beloved Warriors

Our city has always rallied behind our Warriors; we wear their names on our backs, invite them into our homes via the tv, read about them on our phones, and talk about them to our friends. The Warriors symbol can be found all throughout the Bay Area, a proud flag shining bright under our golden Californian sun.

But why do we love our Warriors so much? Do they remind us of home? Of our family? Of ourselves? Is our love for the Warriors modern day triablism at it's finest, or is it something more? Is it something defendable, perhaps, quantifiable even? In short, **yes!**
