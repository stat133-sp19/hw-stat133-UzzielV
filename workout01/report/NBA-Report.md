### An indepth look at the perfomance of San Fransisco's beloved Warriors

Our city has always rallied behind our Warriors; we wear their names on our backs, invite them into our homes via the tv, read about them on our phones, and talk about them to our friends. The Warriors symbol can be found all throughout the Bay Area, a proud flag shining bright under our golden Californian sun.

But why do we love our Warriors so much? Do they remind us of home? Of our family? Of ourselves? Is our love for the Warriors modern day triablism at it's finest, or is it something more? Is it something defendable, perhaps, quantifiable even? In short, **yes!**

The motivation of this article is to show the readers *why* the Bay's love for the Warriors is warranted. To do this, let's first take a stroll down memory lane to see what makes the Warriors so unique.

### History

According to the Warriors' own records [\[1\]](https://www.nba.com/warriors/team_history_index.html), they are one of only 3 original charter teams left in the modern NBA. They share legacies as long and as storied as those of the Knicks and the Celtics. And you know what else? When all the basketball teams in America decided, "Hey, let's get together and compete to see who's best!" the Warriors, well, they showed up and just won the whole dang thing [\[2\]](https://www.nba.com/warriors/team_history_index.html). With this win in the 1946-47 season, the Warriors secured their place in history. As if that wasn't enough, the Warriors claim 18 Hall-of-Famers- while 4 have gone on to coach the team [\[3\]](https://basketball.fandom.com/wiki/Golden_State_Warriors).

### Getting Nerdy

Ok, so the Warriors are good, but how good?.
Welp, if we trust the people over at [Basketball.Fandom.Com](https://basketball.fandom.com/wiki/Basketball_Wiki), they're ridiculously good.

According to the sources at Basketball Wiki, the Warriors hold the NBA record for best season and post-season [\[4\]](https://basketball.fandom.com/wiki/Golden_State_Warriors)! But what does that look like in numbers?

Well, they earned the record for best season with a blistering 73-9 tally. Next, they earned the post-season record with an *astounding* 16-1 tab. Let's do some analysis to see what this means in percentages.

``` r
season_games <- 82
warrior_wins <- 73
season_percent_wins <- warrior_wins/season_games
season_percent_wins
```

    ## [1] 0.8902439

Wow! In their best season, the Warriors won almost 90% of the games they played in; pretty amazing! But, how about for the post-season?

``` r
post_season_games <- 17
warrior_post_wins <- 16
post_percent_wins <- warrior_post_wins/post_season_games
post_percent_wins
```

    ## [1] 0.9411765

A 94% success rate; **remarkable!**

Any way you'd like to slice it, the Warriors play a good game. But, we can still ask, *why* is it that they're so successful? Well, to investigate this, we could anaylze their defensive strategies, but defense only helps to *not* lose games. If you want your team to win, it's all about putting points on the board.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Getting Points on the Board

If you wanna win, you gotta score. It's as simple as that, and our Warriors figured that out a long time ago.
Let's look at a few of our star players. Let's look at Andre Iguodala, Kevin Durant, Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson, and Draymond Green as they shoot from the 2. Looking at these figures from the 2016 Season, our boys had the game in the bag (or perhaps I should say, "in the net").

### Two Pointers? Served All Day Baby

|     Player     | Successes | Attempts | Success Rate |
|:--------------:|:---------:|:--------:|:------------:|
| Andre Iguodala |    134    |    210   |      64%     |
|  Kevin Durant  |    390    |    643   |      61%     |
|  Stephen Curry |    304    |    563   |      53%     |
|  Klay Thompson |    329    |    640   |      51%     |
| Draymond Green |    171    |    346   |      49%     |

If we look at the success rates for these guys, they almost all make over 50% of the baskets they shoot from the 2 point-line. If we were in Vegas, that'd be a good bet to take!

Oh, so you're curious about the 3 point-line? Well, the Warriors handle their business out there too.

### Threes? Yeah, We Got em' Too

|     Player     | Successes | Attempts | Success Rate |
|:--------------:|:---------:|:--------:|:------------:|
|  Klay Thompson |    246    |    580   |      42%     |
|  Stephen Curry |    280    |    687   |      41%     |
|  Kevin Durant  |    105    |    272   |      39%     |
| Andre Iguodala |     58    |    161   |      36%     |
| Draymond Green |     74    |    232   |      32%     |

Even though we see a decrease in the success rate of these shots when compared to shots from the 2 point-line, these are still pretty impressive stats. These Warriors' success rates from the 3 point-line are competing against the best batting averages in the MLB! [\[5\]](https://www.baseball-reference.com/leaders/batting_avg_career.shtml)

### Overall? We Ballin'

|     Player     | Successes | Attempts | Success Rate |
|:--------------:|:---------:|:--------:|:------------:|
|  Kevin Durant  |    495    |    915   |      54%     |
| Andre Iguodala |    192    |    371   |      52%     |
|  Klay Thompson |    575    |   1220   |      47%     |
|  Stephen Curry |    584    |   1250   |      47%     |
| Draymond Green |    245    |    578   |      42%     |

When looking at overall shots taken by these Warriors, its about a 50/50 chance their gonna put points on the board; which is saying a lot in the world of sports.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### When it comes to shooting, we've got our bases covered

Don't think our Warriors need perfect conditions to perform. The chart above shows that these guys can keep sinking shots regardless of where they are on the court.

### We're Your Caps with Pride

So yes reader, when you walk out into the streets tommorrow, wear your Warriors gear with pride and know that 'The Town', is your town.

The Warriors have earned the respect and love of this city!
