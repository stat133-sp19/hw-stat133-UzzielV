### Preparation

1.  Place dried mushrooms in small/ meduim bowl, cover with 1 cup of boiling water; let sit for 20 mins.
2.  Chop fresh mushrooms to desired texture and size.
3.  Heat oil in deep pot, saute oinions and carrots over medium heat until brown (10- 15 mins).
4.  Add fresh mushrooms; cook until they release liquid (5- 10 mins).
5.  Raise heat and add grain (farro, barley, etc.); saute for (5-10 mins).
6.  Add broth, sherry, and tomato paste.
7.  Remove soaking mushrooms from their liquid and finely chop them (keep the liquid).
8.  Strain liquid and add to broth.
9.  Add chopped mushrooms to the broth.
10. Season soup with salt + pepper, let simmer for 40 mins (until grains are tender).
11. Stir in sherry vinegar, adjust final seasoning; enjoy!

 

##### Notes:

-   This recipe is great for Winter or early Fall
-   The stock can be adjusted for diatery restrictions (i.e. veggie stock for vegans, or kosher/ halal stocks)
-   Salt free stock should be used as mushrooms are naturally very salty

Euclidean Distance
------------------

### Definition

The **Euclidean distance** between points **p** and **q** is the length of the line segment connecting them $\\overline{\\textbf{(PQ)}}$.
In Cartesian coordinates, if **p** =(*p*<sub>1</sub>, *p*<sub>2</sub>, ..., *p*<sub>*n*</sub>) and **q** =(*q*<sub>1</sub>, *q*<sub>2</sub>, ..., *q*<sub>*n*</sub>) are two points in Euclidean *n-space*, then the distance (d) from **p** to **q**, or from **q** to **p** is given by the Pythagorean formula:

$$ d(\\textbf{p,} \\textbf{q}) = d(\\textbf{q},\\textbf{p}) = \\sqrt{(q\_1-p\_1)^2 + (q\_2 - p\_2)^2 +...+ (q\_n-p\_n)^2} $$

$$ =\\sqrt{\\sum\_{i =1}^n (q\_i-p\_i)^2}. $$

The position of a point in a Euclidean *n-space* is a Euclidean vector. So, **p** and **q** may be represented as Euclidean vectors, starting from the origin of the space (initial point) with their tips (terminal points) ending at the two points. The **Euclidean norm**, or **Euclidean length**, or **magnitude** of a vector measures the length of the vector:

$$\\left\\|\\textbf{p}\\right\\| = \\sqrt{p\_1^2 + p\_2^2 +...+ p\_n^2} = \\sqrt{\\textbf{p} \\cdot \\textbf{p}}$$

where the last expression involves the dot product.
