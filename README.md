### Savings Account Comparison

---

The financial tool created in this workout was created with the intention of aiding others in their financial planning. It was created in order that others may use it to weigh their options and find what fincial product(s) are best for them.

This tool gives results for 3 different options:

- Traditional savings plan with no annual contribution
- Savings plan with annual contributions
- Index fund with annual contributions

All plans are operating under the same interest rate, time frame, and annual installments that the user determines. By doing so, the customer is able to compare financial products under the same interest rates and make a more informed decision.

In order to make the differences clearer between the different financial options, customers can also choose to *facet* the graphs so that they may see the performance of each product, independent of one another.

We suspect that this tool may greatly aid the public, and will allow them to create a better financial plan for their future.
