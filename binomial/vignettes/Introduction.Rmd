## Binomial

Welcome to the Binomial package. This **R** package will help you to compute any and all of the most essential binomial funcions.
\n

### Operations
The operations in this package include the following:

* **bin_choose( )**: Giving the number of successes in a given number of trials
* **bin_probability( )**: Computing the binomial probability under specified conditions
* **bin_distribution( )**: Gives a dataframe with the listed successes and their probabilities
* **bin_cumulative( )**: Gives a dataframe with the listed successes, thier probabilities, and a cumulative count of probabilities
* **bin_variable( )**: Returns a list of all the relevant variables of a binomial distribution
\n

#### Summary Operations
There are other functions that give measures of your binomial distribution. Ther are as follows:

* **bin_mean( )**: Gives the expected mean of a distribution that you specify
* **bin_varience( )**: Gives the variance of a distribution that you specify
* **bin_mode( )**: Gives the mode of a distribution that you specify
* **bin_skewness( )**: Gives the skewness of a distribution that you specify
* **bin_kurtosis( )**: Gives the kurtosis (taildness) of a distribution that you specify

\n


### Examples

Let's look at how we might utilize Binomial; first we're gonna compute a binomial probability using **bin_probability( )**.

```{r}
bin_probability(k = 2, n = 5, p = 0.5)
```


Wow! Look at the result! The function **bin_probability** returns the probability of getting *k* successes in *n* number of trials with the *p* probability of success.
\n

Now let's see if we can get these visualized. Let's use the function **bin_distribution** to get a bar graph of frequencies and their successes.

```{r}
bin1 <- bin_distribution(n = 5, p = 0.5)
bin1
```
Awesome! Now you can see the results of your distribution in a clear table, but what if you want something nicer to look at?
\n
Well, we can plot the information in this dataframe to give our audience something more appealing. This process is relativeley simple with the **plot( )** function.

```{r}
plot(bin1)
```

Nice! How cool is that!? Of course, you can get fancier with the plots on your own time.

\n

### Summation Examples

Now, let's say you want to get some summation information about your distributions.

Vignettes are long form documentation commonly included in packages. Because they are part of the distribution of the package, they need to be as compact as possible. The `html_vignette` output type provides a custom style sheet (and tweaks some options) to ensure that the resulting html is as small as possible. The `html_vignette` format:

- Never uses retina figures
- Has a smaller default figure size
- Uses a custom CSS stylesheet instead of the default Twitter Bootstrap style

## Vignette Info

Note the various macros within the `vignette` section of the metadata block above. These are required in order to instruct R how to build the vignette. Note that you should change the `title` field and the `\VignetteIndexEntry` to match the title of your vignette.

## Styles

The `html_vignette` template includes a basic CSS theme. To override this theme you can specify your own CSS in the document metadata as follows:

    output: 
      rmarkdown::html_vignette:
        css: mystyles.css

## Figures

The figure sizes have been customised so that you can easily put two images side-by-side. 

```{r, fig.show='hold'}
plot(1:10)
plot(10:1)
```

You can enable figure captions by `fig_caption: yes` in YAML:

    output:
      rmarkdown::html_vignette:
        fig_caption: yes

Then you can use the chunk option `fig.cap = "Your figure caption."` in **knitr**.

## More Examples

You can write math expressions, e.g. $Y = X\beta + \epsilon$, footnotes^[A footnote here.], and tables, e.g. using `knitr::kable()`.

```{r, echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
knitr::kable(head(mtcars, 10))
```
